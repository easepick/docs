# Reporting issues

If you feel you found an issue in `easepick`, we will be grateful for letting us know. Before you create a bug report, please read the guidelines on how to do it properly and most efficiently.

Create an example in a code playground like [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net).

All issues should be reported in the [easepick repository](https://github.com/easepick/easepick) on GitHub.

Things to keep in mind:

* Search for existing issues before starting a new one. This helps to have the backlog in order.
* Be concise and informative, making it easy to understand the problem.
* Do not use the issues pages for asking for help. The project has other [communication channels](/getting-support) for that purpose.
* Feel free to jump into discussions around issues, exposing your opinion!

Issues with third-party plugins should be reported directly to their developers.
